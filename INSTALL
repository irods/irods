iRODS can be built from source with the build.sh script:

  ./packaging/build.sh

Common usages are:

  ./packaging/build.sh icat postgres
  ./packaging/build.sh resource
  ./packaging/build.sh icommands

By default, build.sh will try to build binary packages for your 
platform (via EPM[1]) that can be installed via your platform's 
package manager (dpkg, rpm, etc.).

The --run-in-place flag will skip building the binary packages, and 
will produce configuration files so that iRODS can be run from the 
source directory.  This is not recommended as upgrades and support 
will be more difficult.

Please find more information in manual.rst.
