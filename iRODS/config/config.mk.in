# config/config.mk
#
# This is the iRODS configuration Makefile included in all other
# Makefiles used to build the servers and clients.
#
# The iRODS configuration script copies config/config.mk.in to
# config/config.mk, filling in its best guesses on the OS platform
# and its features.  You can edit this file by hand to modify
# those guesses.
#

#
# Values filled in by the 'configure' script:
# 	OS_platform	The OS for this build.  Platforms supported:
#				alpha_platform
#				sgi_platform
#				solaris_platform
#				sunos_platform
#				aix_platform
#				osx_platform
#				linux_platform
#
#	FILE_64BITS	Whether 64-bit file sizes are supported.
#
#	RODS_CAT	A 1 to enable the iCAT in the iRODS server.
#
#	POSTGRES_HOME	The home directory of Postgres
#
#	MYSQL_HOME	The home directory of MySQL
