The following steps are needed to build and configure Amazon S3 enabled 
servers.

A. Building a S3 enabled server

1) Download build the libs3 library from http://libs3.ischo.com/index.html

2) Edit the config/config.mk file:
    . uncomment the line AMAZON_S3=1, e.g.,
        AMAZON_S3=1
    . define the S3_LIB_DIR (the s3 libraries directory) and 
      S3_HDR_DIR (the s3 header directory). e.g.,
        S3_LIB_DIR=/data1/mwan/s3/libs3-1.4/build/lib
        S3_HDR_DIR=/data1/mwan/s3/libs3-1.4/build/include
3) cd to the irods home directory and type in "make" to re-make the server.

B. Configurating a S3 enabled server

1) cd to the server/config directory and use the file s3Auth.template 
   as the template for the s3Auth file. e.g., 
      cp s3Auth.template s3Auth

   and edit the s3Auth file according to the instructions given in the file. 
   The s3Auth file configures the S3 authentication for the driver.

2) create a S3 resource - The S3 driver is implemented as a compound
   class resource because of the S3 API. As explained in this link: 
   https://www.irods.org/index.php/resource, the compound resource 
   implementation requires a cache class resource to be configured in the 
   same resource group as the compound resource. Data stored in the compound 
   resource cannot be accessed directly but through the cache resource. 
   The following gives an example of creating a S3 resource using iadmin:
      iadmin mkresc s3Resc s3 compound nacho.sdsc.edu /home/irods/Vault 
   
3) Add the S3 and cache resources to a resource group. e.g.,
      iadmain atrg myrescGroup s3Resc
      iadmain atrg myrescGroup cacheResc

   Note: the cacheResc resource must be on a S3 enabled server and does
   not have to be on the same host as the s3Resc. This way, multiple
   cache resources on different hosts can be used as the front-end for
   the S3 resource.
