RBUDP Receiver class.  This class implements the receiver part of RBUDP protocol. First, instantiate the QUANTAnet_rbudpReceiver_c class. Then
call this object's init() method with the host name or IP address of the
sender as parameter.  After the connection is established, you should
immediately call this object's receive(buffer, sizeofBuffer,
sizeofPacket) to receive a buffer.  After you finish receiving all buffers,
you can call this object's close() to close this session.
