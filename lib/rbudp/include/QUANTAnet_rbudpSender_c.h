/**
RBUDP Sender class.   This class implements the sender part of RBUDP protocol. First, instantiate the QUANTAnet_rbudpSender_c class. Then
call this object's init() method with the host name or IP address of the
receiver as parameter. This is a blocking call that waits for the receiver
to make to init() call to connect to the sender.  After that, you can call
this object's send(buffer, sizeofBuffer, sendRate, sizeofPacket) to send
a buffer.  After you finish sending all buffers, you can call this object's
close() to close this session.
